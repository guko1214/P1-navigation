 ## learning algorithm

 The learning algorithm behind the agent is a combination of Q Learning and nerual network. This combination is called Deep Q-Networks developed by DeepMind in 2015.

 Q Learning is value-based method from reinforcement learning. 




# Code implementation

The code implementation consists of two python files (dqn_agent.py.py and model.py.py) and on jupyter notebook.

dqn_agent.py


model.py defines the deep neural network.
The network consists of
